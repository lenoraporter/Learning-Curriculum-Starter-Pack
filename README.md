# Creating your own self-directed learning curriculum
<i>This document was created to help self-educators learn a new skill. Learning a new skill without a formal structure can be hard, but there is a way to mimic an organized format for daily learning. This format is a living guide meaning it is extremely flexible and should be used as a checklist. Too much structure can be too rigid while too much flexibility can cause a wandering mind. Find your balance, write out your malleable guide, and start your learning today!</i>
